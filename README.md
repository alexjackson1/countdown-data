# Countdown Numbers Game Dataset

This dataset contains configurations and solutions for variations of the Countdown numbers game. Each example comprises a sequence of numbers, a target number, the computed solution (closest value), the arithmetic expression that achieves that value, the difference between the target and the computed value, and the final Countdown score.

---

## Dataset Overview

Each data point in the dataset includes:

- **Numbers:**  
  A sequence of $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$ where $s_i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 100\}$ for all $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$, and $n \in \{3, 4, \ldots, 8\}$.
  (Note: In the traditional Countdown game, the numbers are subject to more specific restrictions.)

- **Target:**  
  An integer $t \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 999\}$. (For context, the standard Countdown game usually features targets from 101 and above.)

- **Closest:**  
  The value computed by a solver $r \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 999\}$ that is closest to the target number.

- **Expression:**  
  The arithmetic expression used to compute the closest value.
  For instance, $((2 + 48) \times 5) \div 10$

- **Delta:**  
  The absolute difference between the target and the closest value, i.e. $|t - r|$.

- **Score:**  
  The Countdown score calculated as $\max(0, 10 - |t - r|)$.
  This score reflects how close the computed value is to the target.

## Dataset Variants

This dataset is provided in three variants:

1. **Random:**  
 Configurations and solutions generated by uniformly sampling and solving one million game instances, without additional restrictions.

1. **Random Solvable (Score > 0):**  
 Configurations are generated by uniformly sampling numbers and then **rejecting** any sample that results in an unsolvable instance (i.e., a score of 0). This variant ensures that each instance has a solution that yields a positive score.

1. **Countdown:**  
 Configurations generated by sampling **6 numbers** in the style of the British TV show *Countdown*.

## Generation Process

The dataset was created by:
- Uniformly sampling numbers within the specified ranges.
- Solving each sampled instance to determine the closest value, the corresponding expression, the difference from the target, and the score.
- For the **Random Solvable (Score > 0)** variant, rejection sampling was applied: instances that did not yield a positive score were discarded.

The train and test splits were created by randomly partitioning the instances into 80% training and 20% testing, using a stratified split based on the score and number of starting values.
